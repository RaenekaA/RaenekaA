Hello and thank you for exploring my portfolio!
My name is Raeneka Alexander. After completing the Google Cybersecurity Program, I will obtain my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification.
To hone my understanding of how different platforms and applications function I enjoy analyzing data for patterns to respond to alarms and eliminate data breaches.
I value advancements, peace, and assisting people.
My advantages are integrity, teamwork, adaptability, effective communication, and time management.
The possibilities as a Cybersecurity technician are endless. My ability to analyze data, manage my time efficiently, and the pleasure of doing something good for the benefit of another are beneficial qualities to protect data and assets.
